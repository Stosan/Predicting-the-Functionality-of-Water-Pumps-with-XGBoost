## What is this repo about?
This repository demonstrates how to train and deploy a machine learning model that predicts whether a water pump is functional, non-functional, or functional but needs repair.

In this project I 
- used of various tools and frameworks
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering are carried out with the Pandas and Scikit learn modules
- Features are stored in a feature store **Hopsworks
    - it is serverless, so we do not need to handle infrastructure
    - it has a very generous free tier, with up to 25GB of free storage.
- Models are built with a combination of Scikit Learn and other machine learning libraries
- MLOps is done through NannyML
- Model is deployed through FastAPI



## How to run this code

1. Create a Python virtual environment with the project dependencies with
    ```
    $ make init
    ```

2. Set your Hopsworks project name and API key as environment variables by running the following script (to generate these head to hopsworks.ai, create a free account, create a project and generate an API key for free)
    ```
    $ . ./set_environment_variables.sh
    ```

3. To run the feature pipeline locally
    ```
    $ make run
    ```
